# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
UofT Data Analytics - Analysis on Kickstarter data  
The kickstarter data has revealed a number of interesting insights to pass on to Louise:

*Play Kickstarters in Great Britain were significantly more successful in reaching their goal than the other subcategories in the Theater Category as indicated below:

*Here is a visualization of the outcomes of just the Play Kickstarters in Great Britain:

*The data indicate the success of a kickstarter campaign may be correlated to the time of year in which the campaign is launched. The following graph shows campaigns launched in May and June to have a haigher probability of success:

*The analysis also showed a relationship between the sucess of a campaign and the funding goal although not completely dependent. Failed campaigns were found to have a mean goal of 10 554 pounds where successful campaigns had a mean goal of just 5049 pounds.

When launching the campaign, Louise should take into consideration the funding goal for plays in Great Britain and aim for around the mean since she is planning on asking twice the average successful kickstarter goal. It would also seem wise to launch the kickstarter in May since the data show a higher success rate in that month.
